# directory-monitor
Folder monitor in Java

Using a provided directory, the program starts monitoring the directory and for every file 
that is created in the directory, it subsequently moves the file in another directory, renames 
the file randomly, and finally stores the new and the old file name as a key-value pair in a file.
